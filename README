Monotouch bindings for the Facebook iOS SDK.

You can get the Facebook iOS code from their github page:
http://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk

The FacebookSDKExamples directory has a working example of the DemoApp which was also ported from the Objective-C code.  This example shows the basics of logging in and illustrates some of the things you can do with the API.
